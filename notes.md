What will I teach you?

I will teach you how to build static websites that look nice, using HTML, CSS, and JS. This course will have around 3 main parts to compelete on your own. 

In the first part we will focus on just HTML and CSS

In the second part we will focus on multiple pages, managing our HTML in coordination with CSS, and file locations.

In the third part we will focus on JS and manipulating HTML and CSS using JS. JS is javascript.

The third and second part will be found in the notes folder, if you get confused or lost text me or message me on discord.

After you finish the first, second, and third part, we will focus on your individual skills, and I personally will Teach you UI design.

# HOW TO USE NOTES & Setup Live Server

THIS IS IS SUPER IMPORTANT

right click it on the sidebar and click open preview
<br> or on your keyboard hold: ctrl + shift + v
<br> This will format the info

## Setup

I recommend you use firefox rather than chrome, firefox has better web development tools and is faster than chrome. Especially if you are coding on a school computer.

Live server is a Visual Studio Code extention that allows you to look at your website,
Live server updates your website as you code too.

Install Live server through Extenstions on the sidebar on the right
on the bottom right of VS Code you'll see "Go Live", 
click that and it will open the website on a local server

## Useful tools & Documentation

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) Website that teaches HTML, CSS, and JS. Slighly outdated but very useful and simple to use
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) Best Guide out there for HTML, CSS, and JS. Created by Firefox creators, and is the most up to date resource out there. Slighty more complicated, for more advanced developers. Still very useful regardless of skill level.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) Best website to find errors in code, search for any problem you have in there or just on google, most likely you'll find yourself using this site a lot.

## Useful Web Browser Extentions
You don't have to download these, just optional

- (CSS Overide)[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/css-override/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search] Can remove CSS on any site, honestly not all that useful, just helpful because it helps show the difference between HTML and CSS
- (Color Fish)[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/colorfish-color-picker/] can tell you any color on a website, if you find one you like or want to copy



# HTML Notes

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language

## What are Elements, Tags, and Attributes?
HTML has Elements that are made up of tags
<br> This is a Element: `<h1>Hello World!</h1>`
<br> This is an attribute `class='something'` it would be used like this: `<h1 attribute='something'>Hello</h1>`
<br> This is an opening tag: `<h1>` 
<br> This is a closing tag: `</h1>` Notice it has a forward slash before h1
<br> Data like text goes in between the tags
<br> Not all Elements have a closing tag, like images for example

## Elements
- `<p>Paragraph Element</p>` This is a paragraph element, for paragraphs
- `<h1>Header Element</h1>` This is a header element, for headers
- `<a href='https://youtube.com'>link</a>` This is a link, the href attribute sets the location of where it brings you. if you clicked on it, it would take you to youtube
- `<button onclick='function()'>Click me!</button>` This is a button, we use these with Javascript, we won't use these just yet
- `<img src='image file location'>` image elements dont have closing tags, in the src attribute you would put the location of the image file to display it
- `<input type='text>` input elements dont have closing tags either, in the type attribute you can customzie what type of input it is. For example: type='password' will change it and hide the text inside of it. We won't use these just yet either, because it requires JS.

# CSS Notes

Haven't completed CSS notes yet as of 2/7/2024

First you have to connect your css file to the html file
in between your head tags
1. paste `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`
2. or Shortcut: type link:css and hit enter


block = vertical
<br> inline = horizontal
